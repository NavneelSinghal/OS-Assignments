1. implement vector in C
2. implement sieve in C
    a. first find primes upto sqrt(n) using a simple sieve -- use a safe implementation of sqrt(n)
    b. use this data for segmented sieve
    c. for each chunk allocated to a thread, store the primes found in that iteration in the corresponding vector
    d. at the end of all thread executions, just merge the vectors
