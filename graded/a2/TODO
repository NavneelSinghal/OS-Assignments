1. implement vector in C - done
2. implement sieve in C - done
    a. first find primes upto sqrt(n) using a simple sieve -- use a safe implementation of sqrt(n) - done
    b. use this data for segmented sieve - done
    c. for each chunk allocated to a thread, store the primes found in that iteration in the corresponding vector - done
    d. at the end of all thread executions, just merge the vectors - no merging needed, just read off
3. implement graph plots and all that
4. look into why these plots are so random
