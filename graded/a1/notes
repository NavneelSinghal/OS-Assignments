Part 1: no changes as such

Part 2:

1. File creation: (step 2)

Changed "asmlinkage long sys_hello(void)" to "SYSCALL_DEFINE0(sys_mySyscall)"
Reasons:
    a. sys_hello is not the name we use elsewhere
    b. SYSCALL_DEFINE0 is the new convention for defining the syscall (see linux book)

2. Adding the prototype: (step 5)

Add semicolon to the end of the function, and pass void as a parameter
Reason:
    a. obvious issue

Part 3:

1. Generate configuration file:
First run make menuconfig, then run make localmodconfig (to reduce the number of drivers that are compiled, by looking at only those which are running).

Part 4:

1. uname -r prints 5.8.1Navneel.0360 and not 5.8.1 (since we changed the name)

Making the patch:

sudo diff -ruN dir1 dir2 > patch.patch

Using the patch:

(dry run)
use patch -p1 --dry-run patch.patch

(real thing)
use patch -p1 patch.patch
