1. implement a queue

easy to do

2. implement a scheduler and all

note that a scheduler itself needs to be a single "thread", i.e., of the type we are going to implement

use setjmp and longjmp to implement jump back and forth between the actual thread and the scheduler

SA_NODEFER as given in assignment spec
